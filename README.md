A website showing how much bad grades did I get, from the beginning of the year to now!

Made in Python, using [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) and [vulkan-api](https://github.com/kapi2289/vulcan-api).

## Running
Make sure you're running Python 3.7+ before doing any steps.

1. Clone the repository into a directory of your choice.
2. Move to the directory with the files in a terminal.
3. Run `python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt` to install required requirements.
4. Done! To run the website, do `python3 main.py`.

## Contributing
As with all my projects, contributions are highly appreciated!
